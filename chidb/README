Project 3
=========


Part I:
All done, all located in the compiler code in main.c. Multiple WHERE statements are handled by loops, while multiple tables are coordinated using a struct called "tablelist".
SELECT * statements are handled in a few different locations: in the compiler and in the column name/type functions.

Part II:

Part III:
Not implemented

Part IV:
All done, located within chidb_prepare in main.c. Basically the tables are sorted before any code is generated so that when the code is generated, the loops go from small to large, since the loops are generated in the order they are stored.
